The style you will find in this workshop is the Lee Style,  first bought to the UK in the 1930s from war torn China.</p>\n<p>Our workshop at Shambala will consist of:</p>\n<p>Warming up exercises followed by deep breathing to activate the internal energy, followed by learning some movements from the <strong>T’ai Chi Dance</strong>, a flowing form, designed to stimulate energy at the start of the session. This will be followed by a variety of exercises, helping you to learn how to apply the energy and Taoist principles to everyday situations. One such exercise called sticky hands encourages people to interact with each other in a non-aggressive way even when under pressure.  We will then have a go at some Kaimen exercises which is an ancient form Qigong / Chi Kung, designed to work on various muscle groups and internal organs.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the session we will learn some moves from the <strong>T’ai Chi Form,</strong>  a more concentrated and meditative series of flowing movements. If the exercises are done without any physical tension, the flow of <strong>Chi </strong>is stimulated through the energy meridians and stored in the <strong>Tan Tien, </strong> a region in the lower abdomen just below the navel. With more practice this store of energy overflows and starts to work its way through the whole body right down to the bones. This process helps to regenerate any damaged tissues in the body and so it can aid recovery from disease and slow down the aging process.</p>\n","image_name":"24226.jpg","image_name_small":"24226_small.jpg","production_id":24226,"date_string":"Thu 16:15","sort_order":9},{"id":24460,"start_time":"Thu, Aug 24 17:15:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Thu, Aug 24 18:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Thu","venue":973,"venue_name":"CHAI WALLAHS","name":"Fat Suit","description":"<p><span class=\"s1\"><i>Fat-Suit is a multi-genre music collective from Scotland with deep roots in jazz, funk and soul.

The deal is simple, and proceeds of each copy sold are split equally between vendors and the publisher. Reflecting his own philosophy, the deprived and under-privileged are given a hand up through earning their money, rather than waiting for the hand out which may do little more than trap them in the poverty from which many crave escape. The Big Issue, and similar magazines, is now published in 35 countries around the world; and always with the same aim of helping those struggling for a break in society.</p>\n<p>Although strictly non-political, he has been consulted by Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers about how best to lift people out of poverty through harnessing their own energies.

Their music also features electronic elements, which they refer to as “loopery and laptopery”.</p>\n<p>Influenced by the evocative film soundtracks of Yann Tiersen and Benoît Charest, the genre-melting electronica of early Múm, and the impressionistic writing of Haruki Murakami, the band released their debut album Tricolore in 2013, to critical acclaim. The album was awarded four stars by The Guardian, Uncut, Mojo, Drowned In Sound, and many more. In November 2013, the band toured the UK in support to Lau. They later wrote about the experience in their debut book, “Japanese Poems Steal Brains”, a fully illustrated collection of haikus, which told the story of the band to date.</p>\n<p>Haiku Salut’s second album, “Etch And Etch Deep”, was released in July 2015, to similar acclaim. The album was awarded four stars or above by The Observer, The Guardian, Mojo, Uncut, NME, Clash, Drowned In Sound, The Financial Times, God Is In The TV, Gig Soup, The 405, London In Stereo, The Skinny, and many more.</p>\n<p>Haiku Salut are famed for their mute performances, allowing the music to cast its magical spell. One memorable live review described them as “an experimental orchestra made of loop pedals, accordions, melodicas, and god knows what else. It feels like watching Mary Poppins pull another instrument out of a never-ending bag.”</p>\n","image_name":"23764.jpg","image_name_small":"23764_small.jpg","production_id":23764,"date_string":"Fri 16:00","sort_order":177},{"id":24836,"start_time":"Fri, Aug 25 16:00:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Fri, Aug 25 17:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Fri","venue":24741,"venue_name":"BOTANICAL DISCO","name":"Horny Hen Party","description":" \n \n CALLING ALL HEN-DOS!

Maybe you’ve even been able to control your dreams? Have you wondered if it’s possible to improve the ability to hold stable lucid dreams?</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, is it possible for our dreams to be harnessed to further our spiritual and mental wellbeing?</p>\n<p>In this workshop we will discuss answers to these questions and more, whilst learning some practical techniques that will allow you to delve deeper into your dreaming mind.</p>\n<p>Sleeping and dreaming holds particular significance within Tibetan Buddhism. Both of these night time states of altered consciousness are viewed as fundamentally important opportunities to develop our minds. Combined with particular meditative practices in the day time, before sleep and during sleep, the aim of Dream Yoga is to increase awareness and lucidity in our waking lives, which eventually spills over into the night time. Ultimately, these practices aspire to help prepare the mind to eventually escape Samsara.</p>\n<p>This interactive and participatory workshop at Shambala aims to provide you with a background to the importance placed on dream and sleep practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Guidance will be given on the traditional foundational practices undertaken in the day time which include developing calm abiding (zhiné), changing karmic traces, removing grasping and aversion, strengthening intention and cultivating memory and joyful effort.</p>\n<p>We can then move on to the meditative activities that can be performed through the night that form part of the ‘main practice’ of Tibetan Dream Yoga. Whilst these more extensive practices may not be suitable for everyone throughout a working week, I hope the workshop can provide advice for people interested in developing ways in which they can further their dream practice in the future.</p>\n<p>I also have a personal interest in the science of dream and sleep. Current neuroscience research also offers interesting insights into dreaming and sleep which I believe provide an alternative angle to understand the positive cognitive benefits and alternative realms of consciousness that dream yoga can help give you access to.</p>\n<p>I hope that by the end of the workshop you will be able to leave with some concrete practical suggestions on a variety of meditative exercises, which combined with effort and practice, can allow you to more fully explore the wonderful world of your dreams.</p>\n","image_name":"venues/247.jpg","image_name_small":"venues/247_small.jpg","production_id":24201,"date_string":"Fri 20:45","sort_order":248},{"id":24930,"start_time":"Fri, Aug 25 20:50:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Fri, Aug 25 21:30:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Fri","venue":2037,"venue_name":"REBEL SOUL","name":"Dirty Twisters","description":"<p><span>Punks retiring to the fireside for some trad folk.

Then followed by learning some movements from the <strong>T’ai Chi Dance</strong>, which is a flowing form, designed to stimulate the energy at the start of the session. This may be followed by a variety of exercises, which help you to learn how to apply the energy and Taoist principles to everyday situations. One such exercise called sticky hands encourages people to interact with each other in a non-aggressive way even when under pressure.  We will then have a go at some Kaimen exercises which is an ancient form qigong / chi kung which involves deep breathing and deep stretching and each one is designed to work on various muscle groups and internal organs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Toward the end of the session we will learn some moves from the <strong>T’ai Chi Form, which</strong> is a more concentrated and meditative series of flowing movements. If the exercises are done without any physical tension the flow of <strong>Chi </strong>is stimulated through the energy meridians and it can be stored in the <strong>Tan Tien, which</strong> is a region in the lower abdomen just below the navel. With more practise this store of energy overflows and starts to work its way through the whole body right down to the bones.

This ‘tracing’ has become an important part of the ‘personal’ vision of the band and is a central theme on the album <em>‘Prehistoric Rhythm’</em>. The band has delved into some of those rituals, some of which exist to this day, and reflect on how much contemporary culture has inherited from the past and these ancient traditions.</p>\n<p>With the release of their new album,<em> </em><em>My Baby</em> endeavours to take the audience on a shamanic influenced musical journey.

After early chart success in America for their second LP “Supernatural”, they recorded the Album ‘Connected’ which became an international hit. They embarked on a huge touring schedule including memorable appearances at Glastonbury and many other festivals worldwide. This period culminated with a Mercury prize nomination and 2 Brit awards for Best Album and Best Live Act. Aside from following on their remix activity with mixes for Tricky, Madonna and Quannum MCs amongst others, a period of relative silence followed.

The son of a Congolese father and Austrian mother, Mpunga resides in Vienna, unable until recently to return to his homeland due to the devastating Congolese Civil War.</p>\n<p>Born on Christmas Day 1994, Kimyan Law was a melancholic child. A lone black youth studying in all-white environments he was a victim of racism; a difficult and depressing atmosphere which led him to find respite and consolation in music. Making recordings using instruments improvised from trash he soon graduated from using wood, glass and his own voice to a mastery of drums, piano, marimba and flute, channelling his childhood difficulties into creation.</p>\n<p>At the age of 12 he started exploring the possibilities of electronic music, experimenting with primitive looping on a PSP and then pursuing audio-engineering courses, learning so fast he rapidly started tutoring others. The last couple of years have seen Kimyan Law blossom into the artist we see before us today. Deep explorations into his African roots have led him to create complex mosaics of ancient sound with modern aesthetics. A true ‘artist’ rather than the all-too-common ‘engineer’ found in modern electronica, he constantly talks of the meaning and imagery in his music, referring to his tracks as “portraits” and as having “fragrances”.</p>\n<p>Kimyan Law’s debut LP, ‘Coeur Calme’, was released on Blu Mar Ten Music in October 2014 and was immediately recognised as one of the year’s highlights, seeing him shortlisted for ‘Best New Producer’ at the Drum &amp; Bass Arena Awards, listed second only to Spectrasoul as one of 2014’s best LPs by Ministry of Sound and surrounded by universal praise from audience and peers alike.</p>\n<p>His 2016 follow-up LP, ‘Zawadi’, does not disappoint. Expanding the vocabulary established with ‘Coeur Calme’, Kimyan Law has managed to create a new collection of music even more playful and yet more profoundly serious than the first.</p>\n<p>Having its roots in Drum &amp; Bass, the music flies far beyond the confines of that often-formulaic genre, expanding sonic ranges and disrupting standard arrangements. Mpunga incorporates African instruments and influences into his set up, achieving a rare organic and human quality among the cold electronics. Glittering cascades of tuned percussion are expertly weaved into layers of state-of-the-art bass and the result is a stunning, future/primitive array of romantic and cinematic music that, with its sheer humanity, seduces everyone who experiences it.</p>\n","image_name":"23776.jpg","image_name_small":"23776_small.jpg","production_id":23776,"date_string":"Sat 21:00","sort_order":538},{"id":26374,"start_time":"Sat, Aug 26 21:00:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sat, Aug 26 21:30:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sat","venue":122,"venue_name":"THE ENCHANTED WOODS","name":"Paul Drums","description":"","image_name":"venues/122.jpg","image_name_small":"venues/122_small.jpg","production_id":26374,"date_string":"Sat 21:00","sort_order":539},{"id":24977,"start_time":"Sat, Aug 26 21:10:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sat, Aug 26 22:10:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sat","venue":1126,"venue_name":"THE SOCIAL CLUB","name":"HAPPY HOUR &#8211; STAND UP COMEDY","description":"<p><span>Hosted by musical comedian and king of wordplay, Desmond O’Connor, buckle up for some of the best UK &amp; international comics!</span></p>\n<p><span>Joe Morose has the voice of an angel but the cheek of the devil.

Unfazed by taking to the spotlight after a sober Amy Winehouse or joining Roy Ayers live for ‘Everybody Loves The Sunshine’, there’s no wonder her powerful soul voice has attracted rave reviews from numerous national and international publications and praise from fans as diverse as Gilles Peterson, David Byrne, Dennis Coffey, Massive Attack’s Daddy G, and Groove Armada.</p>\n<p>Alice has also won over a whole host of producers – lending her strong, emotional tones to releases by Mr Scruff, Quantic and Nostalgia 77, the latter pairing producing the ‘Seven Nation Army’ cover that demolished clubs for years.

He played with long-time collaborator Clarky and began to mix all forms of dance music, at house parties and on the radio.Friends FM, run by Mad B. This lead to Nicky joining the ranks of Blackmarket Records in 1990. In 1992, as the house scene moved towards breakbeat, Nicky created a separate department downstairs to cater for the sound that would eventually be called Drum and Bass.In the mid-nineties Nicky pushed the hardcore scene with a regular show on Pulse FM and performances at the Roller Express. He moved into production, making his first record “Spam EP”, along with various remixes and releases on his label Gyroscope, with artists like Ray Keith.</p>\n<p>This exposure fuelled his DJ career and Nicky decided to put all his efforts into playing his music around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>“…first and foremost I am a DJ.”</strong></p>\n<p>As the jungle scene exploded Nicky formed his legendary partnership with the late Stevie Hyper D. These performances are still regarded as the standard by which all others are judged, and MP3s of those sets will probably be on the internet forever.</p>\n<p>Blackmarket Records supported the scene as a focus for the community, an essential component in an world without the internet. Nicky started another label “Kartoonz” featuring the anthem “Two Degrees”, confirming his status as a central force in the scene.</p>\n<p>Unlike many superstars, Nicky still works in his shop and is a promoter of fresh talent and ideas, unafraid to help new artists and organisers push the artform forward. His love of drum and bass keeps him from descending into the mindless repetition and lazy performances characteristic of many in the scene.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Photo credit: Chelone Wolf</strong></p>\n","image_name":"23792.jpg","image_name_small":"23792_small.jpg","production_id":23792,"date_string":"Sat 23:30","sort_order":570},{"id":26034,"start_time":"Sat, Aug 26 23:45:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sat, Aug 26 23:55:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sat","venue":1126,"venue_name":"THE SOCIAL CLUB","name":"AERIAL ACT","description":"","image_name":"venues/1126.jpg","image_name_small":"venues/1126_small.jpg","production_id":26050,"date_string":"Sat 23:45","sort_order":571},{"id":24830,"start_time":"Sat, Aug 26 23:45:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 01:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sat","venue":231,"venue_name":"COMPASS PRESENTS&#8230;","name":"Henge","description":"<p>Greetings Earthlings!

Then followed by learning some movements from the <strong>T’ai Chi Dance</strong>, which is a flowing form, designed to stimulate the energy at the start of the session. This may be followed by a variety of exercises, which help you to learn how to apply the energy and Taoist principles to everyday situations. One such exercise called sticky hands encourages people to interact with each other in a non-aggressive way even when under pressure.  We will then have a go at some Kaimen exercises which is an ancient form Qigong / Chi Kung which involves deep breathing and deep stretching and each one is designed to work on various muscle groups and internal organs.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the session we will learn some moves from the <strong>T’ai Chi Form, which</strong> is a more concentrated and meditative series of flowing movements. If the exercises are done without any physical tension the flow of <strong>Chi </strong>is stimulated through the energy meridians and it can be stored in the <strong>Tan Tien, which</strong> is a region in the lower abdomen just below the navel. With more practise this store of energy overflows and starts to work its way through the whole body right down to the bones. This process helps to regenerate any damaged tissues in the body and so it can aid recovery from disease and slow down the aging process.</p>\n","image_name":"venues/247.jpg","image_name_small":"venues/247_small.jpg","production_id":24170,"date_string":"Sun 09:00","sort_order":610},{"id":24798,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 09:00:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 20:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":9948,"venue_name":"THE FAMILY YURT","name":"The Wishing Tree","description":"","image_name":"24799.jpg","image_name_small":"24799_small.jpg","production_id":24799,"date_string":"Sun 09:00","sort_order":611},{"id":24240,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 10:00:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 11:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":247,"venue_name":"THE HEALING MEADOWS","name":"Tai Chi with Rita","description":"<p>In the Meadow Garden.

Maybe you’ve even been able to control your dreams? Have you wondered if it’s possible to improve the ability to hold stable lucid dreams?</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, is it possible for our dreams to be harnessed to further our spiritual and mental wellbeing?</p>\n<p>In this workshop we will discuss answers to these questions and more, whilst learning some practical techniques that will allow you to delve deeper into your dreaming mind.</p>\n<p>Sleeping and dreaming holds particular significance within Tibetan Buddhism. Both of these night time states of altered consciousness are viewed as fundamentally important opportunities to develop our minds. Combined with particular meditative practices in the day time, before sleep and during sleep, the aim of dream yoga is to increase awareness and lucidity in our waking lives, which eventually spills over into the night time. Ultimately, these practices aspire to help prepare the mind to eventually escape Samsara.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This interactive and participatory workshop at Shambala aims to provide you with a background to the importance placed on dream and sleep practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Guidance will be given on the traditional foundational practices undertaken in the day time which include developing calm abiding (zhiné), changing karmic traces, removing grasping and aversion, strengthening intention and cultivating memory and joyful effort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We can then move on to the meditative activities that can be performed through the night that form part of the ‘main practice’ of Tibetan dream yoga. Whilst these more extensive practices may not be suitable for everyone throughout a working week, I hope the workshop can provide advice for people interested in developing ways in which they can further their dream practice in the future.</p>\n<p>I also have a personal interest in the science of dream and sleep. Current neuroscience research also offers interesting insights into dreaming and sleep which I believe provide an alternative angle to understand the positive cognitive benefits and alternative realms of consciousness that dream yoga can help give you access to.</p>\n<p>I hope that by the end of the workshop you will be able to leave with some concrete practical suggestions on a variety of meditative exercises, which combined with effort and practice, can allow you to more fully explore the wonderful world of your dreams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n","image_name":"venues/247.jpg","image_name_small":"venues/247_small.jpg","production_id":24217,"date_string":"Sun 17:30","sort_order":757},{"id":23733,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 17:45:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 19:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":945,"venue_name":"THE SHAMBALA STAGE","name":"Honeyfeet &#038; Friends","description":"<p>Honeyfeet have been regulars at Shambala for several years now performing stand out shows in Wandering Word, Chai Wallahs and the Social Club.  This year we thought it was high time to present them on the Shambala Stage.  We’ve also asked them to bring along some friends too to make a really special show for you all!</p>\n<p>For a good few years, Honeyfeet has been a conduit for the ideas and expressions of an exotic mixture of Manchester based musicians.

He has been steadfast in his mission to represent the poor and oppressed, using sharp lyrics to confront political injustices and bring the issues of the people to the forefront. In the process, he has raised the quality of performance standards and lyrical content for the industry, through the release of 13 albums, over 1000 singles and appearances on over 100 albums in the last 14 years!  One busy man!</p>\n<p>Anthony B’s musical journey started in the church, back when he was still called Keith Anthony Blair in Clark’s Town, Trelawney. In this part of rural Jamaica, Anthony B was immersed in the thunderous chants and rhythms of Revivalism and the Seventh Day Adventist church where he honed his soon-to-be signature vocals. In his formative years, he also cleaved to the music of Otis Redding and the incomparable Peter Tosh.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Anthony B left his home-town and set out to make his fateful mark on Kingston’s music scene. He rebuked the trend of girl and gun lyrics popular at that time and remained faithful to words of spiritual consciousness and social conviction.  His lyrical genius and his captivating, energetic performance style have caused him to be heavily requested for performances in the Caribbean, North America, Europe and Africa.</p>\n<p>Anthony B’s rich vocals and audacious lyrics carry a depth and substance which is rare in the industry. Internationally, his fan-base has grown because he speaks about the universal concerns of suffering and salvation. “The greatest thing about reggae music is that it’s about concepts and ideas” he says, “you are speaking to people on issues they live and can relate to.”</p>\n<p>This will be a stunning, high energy reggae explosion simply not to be missed!</p>\n","image_name":"24709.jpg","image_name_small":"24709_small.jpg","production_id":24709,"date_string":"Sun 19:30","sort_order":784},{"id":23794,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 19:30:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 21:30:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":949,"venue_name":"THE KAMIKAZE","name":"Awesome Tapes From Africa","description":"<p>Awesome Tapes From Africa was established by Brian Shimkovitz in 2006 to bring to a wider audience the incredible music that he discovered on cassettes while studying in Ghana.  He realised that none of the music could be found outside of West Africa and thought this a crying shame, both for the wider world and also because of the missed opportunity for the artists.

So she did. Her first “real” solo album, <i>Collaborations Volume 1</i>, sees the perfect execution of a wonderfully spontaneous Leonie Evans.</p>\n<p><i>“I was just blown away by her”</i> Cerys Matthews, BBC Radio 6</p>\n<p><i>“Jazz and Folk flirt  en route to New Orleans via Canterbury with Evans’ slinky, supple vocal…One slot on Later with Jools Holland is all it would take</i>” Prog Magazine</p>\n<p>Facebook- facebook.com/Leonieevansmusic</p>\n<p>Twitter- twitter.com/leonierevans</p>\n<p>\n</p>","image_name":"24533.jpg","image_name_small":"24533_small.jpg","production_id":24533,"date_string":"Sun 21:20","sort_order":803},{"id":23664,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 21:30:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 23:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":945,"venue_name":"THE SHAMBALA STAGE","name":"Oumou Sangare","description":"<p>We are delighted to welcome this true giant of African music to Shambala.</p>\n<p>Hailing from Southern Mali, Oumou began singing at a very early age and, by the time she as 13, she was the main breadwinner for her family earning money performing at street parties.  She was spotted at one of these parties and her music career started properly touring Europe with a Malian super group.  Her first solo album, “Massoulou” was released in 1989 when she was only 21 and it took West Africa by storm, not only musically, but also because of the social and political message that she expressed- a message encouraging women to seek personal freedom and dignity and a warning against the wrongs of polygamy and arranged marriages.</p>\n<p>In 1991, the album was played, quite literally, everywhere across the region and it came to the attnetion of Nick Gold of World Circuit Records.  He quickly re-released the album to international acclaim and thus began a relationship that lasted 20 years and produced another 4 incredible and diverse albums.</p>\n<p>In May 2017, a hugely anticipated new album will be released, “Mogoya” on a new label, No Format.  It’s eight years since Oumou Sangaré last released an album and much has changed since we last heard from the greatest living female voice in African music. The power of her voice and the potency of her message remain inviolable but with a new label, an all new production team and a vital new set of songs, “Mogoya” (roughly translates as “people today”) represents an exciting new chapter in Oumou’s career.</p>\n<p>While her sound remains rooted deep in the continuity of Malian tradition, at the same time this is Oumou as we have never heard her before. Recorded in Stockholm by Andreas Unge, and produced in Paris with the crack French production team, Mogoya is a record that both draws upon a rich musical heritage and looks to the future. Traditional African instruments such as the kamele n’goni (harp), karignan (metal scraper) and calabash percussion are augmented by electric guitar, bass, keyboards and even synths while Tony Allen, once Fela Kuti’s band leader, guests on drums.</p>\n<p>Oumou is an artist who is proud of her country and its diverse cultures, now recognised and appreciated throughout the world. An icon and role model for modern women she is both keen to encourage and embrace new ideas through her music whilst at the time she holds a deep respect for tradition and those who came before her.  She continues the battle to encourage equality between men and women and sings about universal themes in life such as love, death, destiny, respect for each other, hope and harmony, not forgetting a couple of light-hearted tunes about the fun things in life.</p>\n<p>On stage her natural presence, huge charisma, irrepressible energy and joie de vivre is very much in evidence. Yet it’s her voice that holds you spellbound and this will be a show that is certainly not to be missed!</p>\n<p> </p>\n","image_name":"23664.jpg","image_name_small":"23664_small.jpg","production_id":23664,"date_string":"Sun 21:30","sort_order":804},{"id":23796,"start_time":"Sun, Aug 27 21:30:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Sun, Aug 27 22:30:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":949,"venue_name":"THE KAMIKAZE","name":"Dark Sky","description":"<p>Matt Benyayer and Tom Edwards together make up the London based production duo Dark Sky.

Clap!","description":"<p>Clap! Clap!, aka Cristiano Crisci, is an internationally acclaimed producer and performer. One of Italy’s brightest new talents, Clap! Clap! brings together disparate inspirations and styles onto the dancefloor of his mind. His music has been supported by Gilles Peterson and featured in GTA V, Boiler Room, Ninja Tune’s Solid Steel mix series, and the FABRIC mix CD series. He has performed his energetic live shows across Europe and Japan and produced for Paul Simon.</p>\n<p> Born and bred in Florence, Crisci began his career in the mid–1990s as a rapper before picking up the saxophone and performing both jazz standards and jazz/punk fusion with Trio Cane. In 2004, he returned to electronic roots with A Smile For Timbuctu, playing synthesisers, releasing four albums, and performing across Europe. By 2008, Crisci decided to strike it out on his own with the Digi G’Alessio project, channeling the same energies as the Los Angeles beat scene. Following a string of EPs and albums under the name, Crisci hit upon a new formula with the Ivory EP, combining samples from the African continent with energetic drum programming. The EP led to the birth of Clap! Clap! in 2013. The stripped-back, high-energy yet inventive sound caught the attention of British label Black Acre with whom Crisci has been working since.</p>\n<p> Clap! Clap!’s music is a unique blend of global dance and timeless sounds drawing from nature, traditional music, field recordings and the electronic savvy of modern centres like Chicago and London. At its core is the inspiration of everyday life, what Crisci calls “the search for new flavours.” This approach anchors Clap! Clap!’s debut album, 2014’s Tayi Bebba, the soundtrack to a tour of an imaginary island. Paul Simon discovered the album through his son, calling it “a masterpiece” and leading him to approach Crisci for help with his latest album, 2016’s Stranger To Stranger. In the end, Crisci provided additional production to three album tracks alongside Simon and Roy Halee.</p>\n<p> Following his work with Paul Simon, Crisci completed his second album as Clap! Clap!, A Thousand Skies. With a softer sound, the new record is a mix of Crisci’s career to date combining samples and live instrumentation from Crisci and collaborators such as South African folk singer Bongeziwe Mabandla, John Wizards, and OY. As with his debut, the album is anchored by a story — this time of a young girl’s journey through the stars — which completes the work. “I like to write what the music gives me when I listen to it,” Crisci explains.</p>\n<p> With a passion for history and the sounds that surround us, Crisci is a unique electronic artist capable of both channeling the energy of the moment and the intricacies of where we come from to create music that can soundtrack where we’re going.</p>\n","image_name":"23707.jpg","image_name_small":"23707_small.jpg","production_id":23707,"date_string":"Mon 01:00","sort_order":854},{"id":24537,"start_time":"Mon, Aug 28 01:40:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Mon, Aug 28 02:40:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":212,"venue_name":"PHANTOM LAUNDRY","name":"DJ Dad","description":"<p>DJ Dad – old boy Bristol and Shambala selector mixes hip hop, soul, funk, dancehall, jazz, drum &amp; bass and sounds yet to be named, to joyous effect.</p>\n","image_name":"24440.jpg","image_name_small":"24440_small.jpg","production_id":24440,"date_string":"Mon 01:40","sort_order":855},{"id":25772,"start_time":"Mon, Aug 28 01:45:00 2017 +01:00","end_time":"Mon, Aug 28 03:00:00 2017 +01:00","filter_day":"Sun","venue":664,"venue_name":"SWINGAMAJIG","name":"Flibb","description":"<p>“Flibb – A creature born from most imfamous and raucous party houses sheffield has ever seen.

This is a seasonal variation, feel free to make up your own recipe based on what ripe and seasonal vegetables you have available to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n \n 800g ripe tomatoes – cut into rough pieces \n 1 bulb garlic – about 8 cloves peeled \n 2 tsp coriander seeds (optional) \n 2 baby aubergines – tips carefully trimmed off, cut in half lengthways \n 1 onion squash – top carefully trimmed off, cut in half, seeds removed, cut into 8 wedges \n 1 courgette – tip carefully trimmed off, cut in half, then in half lengthways \n Bunch 4 spring onions – tips carefully trimmed off, green ends cut off and put to one side, white ends cut in half lengthways \n 1/2 Romanesco – Leaves removed and put to one side, romanesco cut in half, half cut into four wedges attached to the stalk \n 1/4 bunch parsley, picked, stalks very finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped \n 250g bulgur wheat \n Olive oil to grill and saute \n \n<p><strong>Method</strong></p>\n \n First prepare all of your veg. Then heat a thick based large saucepan with a glug of olive oil, the garlic cloves and coriander seeds if using. \n When it’s warm and the garlic is slightly coloured, add the chopped tomatoes. \n Bring to the boil, then turn to a low simmer for ten minutes then remove from the heat. \n Meanwhile bring a griddle or frying pan up to a medium to high temperature. A vegetable at a time, toss them in a little olive oil then place on the griddle or frying pan if using. \n Leave until slightly charred on one side, then turn and char the other side, working through all the vegetables putting them in a bowl to one side as they are cooked. \n Please note the onion squash and aubergines should be cooked a bit longer than the rest of the vegetables to make sure they are cooked through. \n Heat the tomato sauce and add the vegetables. Cook on a low heat until the vegetables are tender, turn in the romanesco leaves and half the parsley leaves and stalks. \n To cook the bulgur heat up some water until it is warm like hot bath temperature. \n Rub the bulgur with a little olive oil. \n Pour water over the bulgur wheat in a container until just covered. Cover with a lid or some parchment and leave for 20 minutes to sit and cook. When it is done it should still be ever so slightly chewy but cooked through. \n To finish turn through the rest of the parsley leaves and stalks and the tops of the spring onions. \n \n<p> </p>\n","venue_type":"retailer","image_name":"23990.jpg","image_name_small":"23990_small.jpg","lat":"52.41148674","long":"-0.923162969","menu":"<p><strong>Poco Menu</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><span><strong>Breakfast - served until 1pm</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shakshuka £5.00</strong></p>\n\n<p>North African style breakfast of organic eggs poached in a rich tomato sauce with toasted sourdough.

Keep mixing it up until the cheese melts, don’t be coy about adding more cheese, it’s the best bit! \n Once it’s mashed up, you can add your colourful layers of salad! Start with the salad leaves, then tomatoes, sweetcorn, jalapenos, olives and gherkins. Get as creative as you want! \n Pile a nice big spoon full of yoghurt in the centre and zig-zag your favourite spicy sauce on top. \n Decorate with crispy onion and vegan ‘bacon’ bits or any croutons or crumbs for taste.

Something that they would want to eat themselves, and that they would be proud to stand behind and sell directly to customers.</p>\n<p>Dairy sheep give relatively small yields but their milk is much more concentrated than cow’s milk. It has more butterfat and more protein than cow’s milk. So they were able to make ice cream just using whole milk. No extra cream or butter required.</p>\n<p>The ice cream was light and fresh and to match it, they set out to make their own flavours directly from raw ingredients wherever possible. They have learnt quite a bit in the intervening thirty years. But their philosophy is still the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Take fresh milk straight from the farm. Pasteurise it. Flavour it. Churn it. Freeze it. Scoop it.</strong> .</p>\n<p>That’s it. That’s Shepherds. Real food. Short chains. No middle-men. No messing.</p>\n<p>Their recipe uses whole sheep’s milk to produce an ice-cream that is smooth and creamy but lower in fat than conventional cream-based products – typically less than 6 % fat as against 10-12% fat.</p>\n<p>Their sorbets are made using pure fruit and spring water. All products are suitable for vegetarians and gluten-free diets. Sorbets are suitable for vegans. Sheep’s milk is also suitable for most people on dairy-free diets.</p>\n SHEPHERD’S BASIC VANILLA RECIPE – TRY IT AT HOME! \n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n \n 600ml sheeps milk \n 6 egg yolks \n 120 gms sugar \n 1 tsp cornflour \n Vanilla pod \n \n<p><strong>Method</strong></p>\n \n Pour the milk into a saucepan. Bring it to the boil, then remove the pan from the heat, add the vanilla pod and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. \n Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla pod and put them back into the milk \n Whisk the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour in a bowl until thick and foamy. \n Bring the infused milk to the boil then gradually whisk it into the egg, sugar, cornflour mix. \n Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until it approaches boiling point and thickens to the point where the custard will coat the back of a wooden spoon. Do not let the custard overheat or it may curdle. \n Take the pan off the heat and continue stirring, making sure to take the spoon right around the bottom edges of the pan. \n Pour the custard into a bowl and cover the surface with clear film to prevent the formation of a skin. \n Leave to cool, then chill in the fridge until required. \n \n<p><strong>Freezing ice cream</strong></p>\n \n Remove from the freezer while freezing and beat the mixture, do this every 15 –30 minutes. \n Beating the ice cream, either by hand or with an ice cream maker, breaks down the ice crystals. \n The more it is beaten while it is freezing, the finer and silkier the finished texture will be. \n \n","venue_type":"retailer","image_name":"23997.jpg","image_name_small":"23997_small.jpg","lat":null,"long":null,"menu":"<p><span><strong>Shepherd's Menu</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ice cream flavours</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vanilla, chocolate, tayberry, mango and coconut, mint chocolate chip, toffee and honeycomb, blackcurrant and liquorice, ginger, cherry yoghurt, cinnamon chai, peanut butter and chocolate, lemon and poppyseed, Lebanese coffee.</p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Sorbet flavours</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Mango, strawberry, raspberry, elderflower, passionfruit.</p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Prices</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Single waffle cone or tub £2.70</p>\n\n<p>Double waffle cone or tub £4.00</p>\n\n<p>Kid's cone or tub £2.00</p>","has_location":false},{"id":23995,"name":"Shamburger","description":"<p>Shamburger was born in Bristol out of swooningly passionate love of burgers AND the planet – turns out those two things don’t need to be mutually exclusive, after all!

The archiving of these posters, both handwritten and digital, seeks to build a more complex picture of identity and nationality, exploring our unique family origins, in turn aiming to destigmatise the word ‘migrant’. </span></p>\n<p>\n</p>"},{"id":24955,"last_updated_timestamp":1498828282,"name":"Cerebral Sessions","image_name":"24955.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/jeremy-thomas-63102-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/jeremy-thomas-63102-125x187.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/jeremy-thomas-63102-768x1152.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/jeremy-thomas-63102-356x534.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/jeremy-thomas-63102.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[24955,24959],"description":"<p><span class=\"s1\">Music That Makes Your Brain Work Better</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">In the Imaginarium, we pride ourselves on leaving your grey matter better than we found it.

He’ll be talking about the importance of an ‘open-sourced’ economy and sharing as part of a thriving global community.</p>\n<p>He was brought up in an orphanage and served time in a young offenders’ institution. During turbulent and difficult times, he slept rough as one of London’s homeless.<br>\n​<br>\nSettling down in his 20’s, he began to hold down regular jobs in factories and, eventually, as a skilled printer. He never forgot the hardship and problems of his youth – and the ways in which similar deprivation afflicts thousands of others in similar positions.<br>\n​<br>\nTwenty-six years ago this year, using his experience of the print industry, he co-founded (the now world-famous) The Big Issue. The weekly magazine achieves its mass circulation by being sold on the streets of the UK by vendors who are homeless and vulnerably accommodated. The deal is simple, and proceeds of each copy sold are split equally between vendors and the publisher. Reflecting his own philosophy, the deprived and under-privileged are given a hand up through earning their money, rather than waiting for the hand out which may do little more than trap them in the poverty from which many crave escape. The Big Issue, and similar magazines, is now published in 35 countries around the world; and always with the same aim of helping those struggling for a break in society.</p>\n<p>Although strictly non-political, he has been consulted by Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers about how best to lift people out of poverty through harnessing their own energies. And a new created, independent Crossbench Peer, he’ll continue to do this in the UK Parliament.</p>\n"},{"id":24207,"last_updated_timestamp":1497358910,"name":"Introduction to Aromatherapy with Christine Heacker","image_name":"24207.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-18-at-15.48.06-205x137.png","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-18-at-15.48.06-280x175.png","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-18-at-15.48.06-768x479.png","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-18-at-15.48.06-855x534.png","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-18-at-15.48.06.png"},"tags":[67],"events":[24207],"description":"<p>Experience a sensual introduction to the world of essential oils and aromatherapy massage.

He has been steadfast in his mission to represent the poor and oppressed, using sharp lyrics to confront political injustices and bring the issues of the people to the forefront. In the process, he has raised the quality of performance standards and lyrical content for the industry, through the release of 13 albums, over 1000 singles and appearances on over 100 albums in the last 14 years!  One busy man!</p>\n<p>Anthony B’s musical journey started in the church, back when he was still called Keith Anthony Blair in Clark’s Town, Trelawney. In this part of rural Jamaica, Anthony B was immersed in the thunderous chants and rhythms of Revivalism and the Seventh Day Adventist church where he honed his soon-to-be signature vocals. In his formative years, he also cleaved to the music of Otis Redding and the incomparable Peter Tosh.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Anthony B left his home-town and set out to make his fateful mark on Kingston’s music scene. He rebuked the trend of girl and gun lyrics popular at that time and remained faithful to words of spiritual consciousness and social conviction.  His lyrical genius and his captivating, energetic performance style have caused him to be heavily requested for performances in the Caribbean, North America, Europe and Africa.</p>\n<p>Anthony B’s rich vocals and audacious lyrics carry a depth and substance which is rare in the industry. Internationally, his fan-base has grown because he speaks about the universal concerns of suffering and salvation. “The greatest thing about reggae music is that it’s about concepts and ideas” he says, “you are speaking to people on issues they live and can relate to.”</p>\n<p>This will be a stunning, high energy reggae explosion simply not to be missed!</p>\n"},{"id":24685,"last_updated_timestamp":1502380378,"name":"U Roy &#038; The Robotiks","image_name":"24685.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/u-Roy-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/u-Roy-280x150.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/u-Roy-768x412.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/u-Roy.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/u-Roy.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[24685],"description":"<p>What a massive treat it is to welcome the pioneering Jamaican vocalist U-Roy and his kick ass band, The Robotiks, to Shambala.</p>\n<p>Though it is an oft over used term, U Roy truly deserves the description of “living legend” having kicked off his career on the seminal Treasure Isle label. when, in 1970 alone, he, alongside the producer Duke Reid, released 3 hits that made the top ten- Wear you to the ball, Version Galore and You’ll Never Get Away,  Immediately U Roy was clearly a new and exciting phenomenon- a phenomenon that kicked off the all the talkers, chatters, toasters and rappers that would follow… the age of the MCs had begun!</p>\n<p>This year, U Roy is releasing a brand new album on Mad Professor’s timeless label, Ariwa.  The album, “Talking Roots” contains a broadside sample of the career of the King of the Rappers.  The album maintains reggae’s legacy of broadcasting current affairs, especially on the track “Repatriation” where U Roy touches on Mr Trump’s immigration policy, like a BBC reporter, cleverly without agreeing or disagreeing.  On other tracks he explores more jovial topics such as the bitter cola nut, the original sexual health weapon from Africa and on the track “Teacher Morris” he reflects on school boy romantic fantasy.</p>\n<p>What a treat it is to welcome a legend who has been performing and producing music for almost 50 years while still remaining relevant, though provoking and blazing a path for others to follow.</p>\n<p>We cannot wait!</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},{"id":24322,"last_updated_timestamp":1498047485,"name":"Maya Youssef","image_name":"24322.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-10.18.13-205x137.png","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-10.18.13-280x187.png","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-10.18.13-768x510.png","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-10.18.13-803x534.png","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-10.18.13.png"},"tags":[66],"events":[24322],"description":"<p>Maya’s virtuosity and unique innovative approach to playing the kanun, a traditional Syrian instrument, have expanded her audiences to international platforms.

Have you wondered if it’s possible to improve the ability to hold stable lucid dreams?</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, is it possible for our dreams to be harnessed to further our spiritual and mental wellbeing?</p>\n<p>In this workshop we will discuss answers to these questions and more, whilst learning some practical techniques that will allow you to delve deeper into your dreaming mind.</p>\n<p>Sleeping and dreaming holds particular significance within Tibetan Buddhism. Both of these night time states of altered consciousness are viewed as fundamentally important opportunities to develop our minds. Combined with particular meditative practices in the day time, before sleep and during sleep, the aim of Dream Yoga is to increase awareness and lucidity in our waking lives, which eventually spills over into the night time. Ultimately, these practices aspire to help prepare the mind to eventually escape Samsara.</p>\n<p>This interactive and participatory workshop at Shambala aims to provide you with a background to the importance placed on dream and sleep practice in Tibetan Buddhism.

He played with long-time collaborator Clarky and began to mix all forms of dance music, at house parties and on the radio.Friends FM, run by Mad B. This lead to Nicky joining the ranks of Blackmarket Records in 1990. In 1992, as the house scene moved towards breakbeat, Nicky created a separate department downstairs to cater for the sound that would eventually be called Drum and Bass.In the mid-nineties Nicky pushed the hardcore scene with a regular show on Pulse FM and performances at the Roller Express. He moved into production, making his first record “Spam EP”, along with various remixes and releases on his label Gyroscope, with artists like Ray Keith.</p>\n<p>This exposure fuelled his DJ career and Nicky decided to put all his efforts into playing his music around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>“…first and foremost I am a DJ.”</strong></p>\n<p>As the jungle scene exploded Nicky formed his legendary partnership with the late Stevie Hyper D. These performances are still regarded as the standard by which all others are judged, and MP3s of those sets will probably be on the internet forever.</p>\n<p>Blackmarket Records supported the scene as a focus for the community, an essential component in an world without the internet. Nicky started another label “Kartoonz” featuring the anthem “Two Degrees”, confirming his status as a central force in the scene.</p>\n<p>Unlike many superstars, Nicky still works in his shop and is a promoter of fresh talent and ideas, unafraid to help new artists and organisers push the artform forward. His love of drum and bass keeps him from descending into the mindless repetition and lazy performances characteristic of many in the scene.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Photo credit: Chelone Wolf</strong></p>\n"},{"id":23794,"last_updated_timestamp":1498070209,"name":"Awesome Tapes From Africa","image_name":"23794.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/awesometapesfromafrica-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/awesometapesfromafrica-280x159.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/awesometapesfromafrica-768x437.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/awesometapesfromafrica-880x501.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/awesometapesfromafrica.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[23794],"description":"<p>Awesome Tapes From Africa was established by Brian Shimkovitz in 2006 to bring to a wider audience the incredible music that he discovered on cassettes while studying in Ghana.  He realised that none of the music could be found outside of West Africa and thought this a crying shame, both for the wider world and also because of the missed opportunity for the artists.

The son of a Congolese father and Austrian mother, Mpunga resides in Vienna, unable until recently to return to his homeland due to the devastating Congolese Civil War.</p>\n<p>Born on Christmas Day 1994, Kimyan Law was a melancholic child. A lone black youth studying in all-white environments he was a victim of racism; a difficult and depressing atmosphere which led him to find respite and consolation in music. Making recordings using instruments improvised from trash he soon graduated from using wood, glass and his own voice to a mastery of drums, piano, marimba and flute, channelling his childhood difficulties into creation.</p>\n<p>At the age of 12 he started exploring the possibilities of electronic music, experimenting with primitive looping on a PSP and then pursuing audio-engineering courses, learning so fast he rapidly started tutoring others. The last couple of years have seen Kimyan Law blossom into the artist we see before us today. Deep explorations into his African roots have led him to create complex mosaics of ancient sound with modern aesthetics. A true ‘artist’ rather than the all-too-common ‘engineer’ found in modern electronica, he constantly talks of the meaning and imagery in his music, referring to his tracks as “portraits” and as having “fragrances”.</p>\n<p>Kimyan Law’s debut LP, ‘Coeur Calme’, was released on Blu Mar Ten Music in October 2014 and was immediately recognised as one of the year’s highlights, seeing him shortlisted for ‘Best New Producer’ at the Drum &amp; Bass Arena Awards, listed second only to Spectrasoul as one of 2014’s best LPs by Ministry of Sound and surrounded by universal praise from audience and peers alike.</p>\n<p>His 2016 follow-up LP, ‘Zawadi’, does not disappoint. Expanding the vocabulary established with ‘Coeur Calme’, Kimyan Law has managed to create a new collection of music even more playful and yet more profoundly serious than the first.</p>\n<p>Having its roots in Drum &amp; Bass, the music flies far beyond the confines of that often-formulaic genre, expanding sonic ranges and disrupting standard arrangements. Mpunga incorporates African instruments and influences into his set up, achieving a rare organic and human quality among the cold electronics. Glittering cascades of tuned percussion are expertly weaved into layers of state-of-the-art bass and the result is a stunning, future/primitive array of romantic and cinematic music that, with its sheer humanity, seduces everyone who experiences it.</p>\n"},{"id":23774,"last_updated_timestamp":1502823371,"name":"Chali 2Na &amp; Krafty Kuts","image_name":"23774.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/KraftyKutsChali2CHARACTERSforweb-1-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/KraftyKutsChali2CHARACTERSforweb-1-190x187.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/KraftyKutsChali2CHARACTERSforweb-1-768x755.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/KraftyKutsChali2CHARACTERSforweb-1-543x534.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/KraftyKutsChali2CHARACTERSforweb-1.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[23774],"description":"<p><span class=\"s1\">Renowned and respected worldwide for his highly technical turntablism, meticulously crafted DJ sets and party-punching productions, Krafty Kuts is in a league of his own.  Having clocked in six million plays on soundcloud and with his Golden Era Podcasts topping the iTunes charts in 26 countries and hitting 3 million downloads his place in the turn table hall of fame as firmly been cemented and was one of the reasons why Red Bull 3 Style asked him to be one of their judges alongside Jazzy Jeff, Invisible Skratch Pickles and Skratch Bastid.</span></p>\n<p> <span class=\"s1\">One of the key pioneers in the UK breakbeat and bass movement, Krafty Kuts has multiple awards to his name and has released music on the likes of Ministry Of Sound, OWSLA, Southern Fried, DMC, Fabric and been asked to remix Dead Prez, Jurassic 5, JVC force.

Unfazed by taking to the spotlight after a sober Amy Winehouse or joining Roy Ayers live for ‘Everybody Loves The Sunshine’, there’s no wonder her powerful soul voice has attracted rave reviews from numerous national and international publications and praise from fans as diverse as Gilles Peterson, David Byrne, Dennis Coffey, Massive Attack’s Daddy G, and Groove Armada.</p>\n<p>Alice has also won over a whole host of producers – lending her strong, emotional tones to releases by Mr Scruff, Quantic and Nostalgia 77, the latter pairing producing the ‘Seven Nation Army’ cover that demolished clubs for years.

The power of her voice and the potency of her message remain inviolable but with a new label, an all new production team and a vital new set of songs, “Mogoya” (roughly translates as “people today”) represents an exciting new chapter in Oumou’s career.</p>\n<p>While her sound remains rooted deep in the continuity of Malian tradition, at the same time this is Oumou as we have never heard her before. Recorded in Stockholm by Andreas Unge, and produced in Paris with the crack French production team, Mogoya is a record that both draws upon a rich musical heritage and looks to the future. Traditional African instruments such as the kamele n’goni (harp), karignan (metal scraper) and calabash percussion are augmented by electric guitar, bass, keyboards and even synths while Tony Allen, once Fela Kuti’s band leader, guests on drums.</p>\n<p>Oumou is an artist who is proud of her country and its diverse cultures, now recognised and appreciated throughout the world. An icon and role model for modern women she is both keen to encourage and embrace new ideas through her music whilst at the time she holds a deep respect for tradition and those who came before her.  She continues the battle to encourage equality between men and women and sings about universal themes in life such as love, death, destiny, respect for each other, hope and harmony, not forgetting a couple of light-hearted tunes about the fun things in life.</p>\n<p>On stage her natural presence, huge charisma, irrepressible energy and joie de vivre is very much in evidence. Yet it’s her voice that holds you spellbound and this will be a show that is certainly not to be missed!</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},{"id":23707,"last_updated_timestamp":1502829742,"name":"Clap!

Clap!, aka Cristiano Crisci, is an internationally acclaimed producer and performer. One of Italy’s brightest new talents, Clap! Clap! brings together disparate inspirations and styles onto the dancefloor of his mind. His music has been supported by Gilles Peterson and featured in GTA V, Boiler Room, Ninja Tune’s Solid Steel mix series, and the FABRIC mix CD series. He has performed his energetic live shows across Europe and Japan and produced for Paul Simon.</p>\n<p> Born and bred in Florence, Crisci began his career in the mid–1990s as a rapper before picking up the saxophone and performing both jazz standards and jazz/punk fusion with Trio Cane. In 2004, he returned to electronic roots with A Smile For Timbuctu, playing synthesisers, releasing four albums, and performing across Europe. By 2008, Crisci decided to strike it out on his own with the Digi G’Alessio project, channeling the same energies as the Los Angeles beat scene. Following a string of EPs and albums under the name, Crisci hit upon a new formula with the Ivory EP, combining samples from the African continent with energetic drum programming. The EP led to the birth of Clap! Clap! in 2013. The stripped-back, high-energy yet inventive sound caught the attention of British label Black Acre with whom Crisci has been working since.</p>\n<p> Clap! Clap!’s music is a unique blend of global dance and timeless sounds drawing from nature, traditional music, field recordings and the electronic savvy of modern centres like Chicago and London. At its core is the inspiration of everyday life, what Crisci calls “the search for new flavours.” This approach anchors Clap! Clap!’s debut album, 2014’s Tayi Bebba, the soundtrack to a tour of an imaginary island. Paul Simon discovered the album through his son, calling it “a masterpiece” and leading him to approach Crisci for help with his latest album, 2016’s Stranger To Stranger. In the end, Crisci provided additional production to three album tracks alongside Simon and Roy Halee.</p>\n<p> Following his work with Paul Simon, Crisci completed his second album as Clap! Clap!, A Thousand Skies. With a softer sound, the new record is a mix of Crisci’s career to date combining samples and live instrumentation from Crisci and collaborators such as South African folk singer Bongeziwe Mabandla, John Wizards, and OY. As with his debut, the album is anchored by a story — this time of a young girl’s journey through the stars — which completes the work. “I like to write what the music gives me when I listen to it,” Crisci explains.</p>\n<p> With a passion for history and the sounds that surround us, Crisci is a unique electronic artist capable of both channeling the energy of the moment and the intricacies of where we come from to create music that can soundtrack where we’re going.</p>\n"},{"id":23639,"last_updated_timestamp":1502822417,"name":"Stereo MCs","image_name":"23639.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/StereoMCs6-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/StereoMCs6-280x187.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/StereoMCs6-768x512.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/StereoMCs6-801x534.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/StereoMCs6.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[23639],"description":"<p>Born out of the mid 80’s inspirational hip hop scene and the DIY UK acid house/club scene the Stereo MCs’ reputation grew slowly and then simply exploded with their seminal album “Connected” which, this year, celebrates 25 years!</p>\n<p>During the 80s the Stereo MCs started an underground dance label, releasing diverse artists from Richie Rich to the Jungle Brothers as well as their own records before being picked up by Island Records.

After early chart success in America for their second LP “Supernatural”, they recorded the Album ‘Connected’ which became an international hit. They embarked on a huge touring schedule including memorable appearances at Glastonbury and many other festivals worldwide. This period culminated with a Mercury prize nomination and 2 Brit awards for Best Album and Best Live Act. Aside from following on their remix activity with mixes for Tricky, Madonna and Quannum MCs amongst others, a period of relative silence followed.

It has jazz &amp; psychedelic influences too, resulting in mesmerising tunes with heavyweight horn lines.</p>\n"},{"id":23654,"last_updated_timestamp":1498038827,"name":"Soccer96","image_name":"23654.jpg","image":{"thumbnail":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Soccer96_Press-Shot_1_159-205x137.jpg","medium":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Soccer96_Press-Shot_1_159-280x187.jpg","medium_large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Soccer96_Press-Shot_1_159-768x512.jpg","large":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Soccer96_Press-Shot_1_159-801x534.jpg","full":"https://www.shambalafestival.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Soccer96_Press-Shot_1_159.jpg"},"tags":[66],"events":[23654],"description":"<p>London-based duo Soccer96 transmit epic synth-scapes over poly-rhythmic drums and infectious dance grooves in a brutal cocktail of tight electronica and the spontaneous energy of improvisation delivering a fearless show of musicianship and floor-filling potency.</p>\n<p>The synth and drums duo of Danalogue [Dan Leavers] and Betamax [Max Hallett] are most known as being two thirds of The Comet Is Coming [with Shabaka Hutchings].

This enables us to put data privacy and anonymity at the core of its architecture and is the beginning of a wider enquiry into the digital landscape we live in and alternatives we can explore as a community.</p>\n\t\t<p>We were motivated to do it the hard way for two reasons; the freedom to design the app we want fulfilling our own creative ambitions and because nothing is really ‘free’ when you are paying with personal information and data. We want to resist (and debate) the relentless and rapid march of “big data” capture, and it's profound impact on our world. 'Free' to use apps are commonly designed and licensed in such a way that the individual exchanges huge amounts information for the privilege. </p>\n\t\t<p>When you downloaded the app you were not required to enter any personal identification information. This does not negate all identifiers that exist within phones and networks, but should reassure you that we are not gathering (nor selling!) any such personal information. We are not logging user information, we are not capturing IP addresses, server logs are rotated and deleted regularly and the feedback form is anonymous (unless you enter your contact details). </p>\n\t\t<p>This is just the beginning of a wider enquiry into the digital landscape we live in and viable peer-to-peer opportunities. We are imagining a supportive decentralised digital community that treats all its peers equally and affords the opportunity for all to participate in a project with an open source ethos, putting all the amazing individuals that are part of our community at its heart and in control of their own data and privacy.
